Project Focus: To implement a virtual simulation lab for the School & University.

Abstract:
It is always an issue for students when they have to appear on practical exams, as they cannot do proper practicing.
It is a common issue in India as the teacher and the student ratio is 1:24[reference]. Also, schools and universities cannot afford 
teachers and equipment for each student. Therefore, to resolve this problem and help the students like us, we are planning to create
a "Virtual Simulation Lab”. It will be a platform from which, students will be able to practice the electrical circuit connection, 
read lab manuals, get an observation table, plot graph and do some MCQs. This can help not just the student from schools and universities
but can be useful for the researchers too. 

The result will be a website that will be made from “html, css and js”.
